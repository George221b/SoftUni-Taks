01| [Sebastian's Verse: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
02| City of stars
03| Are you shining just for me?
04| City of stars
05| There's so much that I can't see
06| Who knows?
07| I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
08| That now our dreams
09| They've finally come true
10| 
11| [Mia's Verse: Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling]
12| City of stars
13| Just one thing everybody wants
14| There in the bars
15| And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
16| It's love
17| Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
18| A rush
19| A glance
20| A touch
21| A dance
22| 
23| [Duet: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
24| A look in somebody's eyes
25| To light up the skies
26| To open the world and send it reeling
27| A voice that says, I'll be here
28| And you'll be alright
29| 
30| I don't care if I know
31| Just where I will go
32| 'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
33| A rat-tat-tat on my heart
34| 
35| [Outro: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
36| Think I want it to stay
37| City of stars
38| Are you shining just for me?
39| City of stars
40| You never shined so brightly
