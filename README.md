<p>In this repo I collected some of the courses I finished, while studying at SoftUni. Each course contains <strong>labs</strong> (which are exercises during lectures), <strong>exercises</strong> (homework, done at home, usually harder than labs) and <strong>exams</strong>.<br /> <br /> Almost all folders with exercises contain a <strong>Readme.md</strong> file, which holds information about each exercise. Feel free to examine or look though the folders and exercises.<br /> <br /> Here are some interesting examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/JSApplications/10.Exam">Single Page Application</a> made with Sammy.js and Handlebars.js. If you want to test it, don&rsquo;t forget to launch a local test server.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/JSAdvanced/11.UnitTesting-Exercise">Unit Testing in Node.js</a> with Mocha &amp; Chai</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/C%23OOP-Advanced/06.UnitTesting-Exercise">C# Unit Testing</a> with NUnit</li>
<li>C# <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/blob/master/C%23OOP-Advanced/05.Reflection-Exercise/03BarracksFactory/Core/CommandInterpreter.cs">Command Pattern</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/blob/master/C%23OOP-Advanced/05.Reflection-Exercise/03BarracksFactory/Core/Factories/UnitFactory.cs">Factory Pattern</a> made with <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/C%23OOP-Advanced/05.Reflection-Exercise">Reflection </a></li>
<li>Many interesting C# mini <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/JSAdvanced/11.UnitTesting-Exercise">tasks</a> / <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/Exercises">exams</a>.</li>
<li>Interesting <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/blob/master/Algorithms/01.Recursion-Exercise/06.ConnectedAreasinMatrix2/Program.cs">Recursion</a> exercises with C#. See more <a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/Algorithms/01.Recursion-Exercise">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/George221b/SoftUni-Tasks/tree/master/Algorithms/08.AdvancedGraphAlgorithmsPart1-Lab">Many tasks</a> for Graphs with C#.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more examples, which are interesting to share and see, but I simply can&rsquo;t list them all.&nbsp; My study at SoftUni lasted for a year and a half and for that period I made hundreds of exercises, some are here, others are not.</p>
